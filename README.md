# altjs
Alternative JavaScript within Reason: A fluid lightweight framework for smoothest data patterns in the best of ways.

## Framework Origins

I created [data-command](https://github.com/fantasyui-com/data-command) briefly pondered [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)/[E4X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript_for_XML) and [sweetjs](https://www.sweetjs.org) and decided that the three were not the correct paths forward. I found [h](https://www.npmjs.com/package/h) to be very promising and [d3](https://d3js.org/) to point toward the correct directions, but it was too hard to comprehend application structure. Therefore I looked to the Container/Component/Repeater pattern, but rather than the commpn approach that binds the data within, here the data is what drives the instantiation of the trio.
